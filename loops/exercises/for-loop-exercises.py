# Exercise #1: Construct for loops that accomplish the following tasks:
    # a. Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
    # b. Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
    # c. Print the EVEN numbers 12 to -14 in descending order, one number per line.
    # d. Challenge - Print the numbers 50 - 20 in descending order, but only if the numbers are multiples of 3. (Your code should work even if you replace 50 or 20 with other numbers).


# for num in range(21): #initiates the for loop, assigns a loop variable (num) and estbalishes a range using the range function
#     print(num) #prints num for each iteration

# for num in range(3,30,2):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(12,-15,-2):
#     print(num)


# for num in range(50,20,-1):
#    if num %3 == 0:
#       print(num)
