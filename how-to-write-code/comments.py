# This demo shows off comments!

# print("This does not print.");

print("Hello, World!"); # Comments do not have to start at the beginning of a line.

# Here is how
# to have
# multi-line
# comments.

print("Comments make your code more readable by others."); #using the shortcut to comments comments out a full line
# but commenting out a full line
# is easier when you
# are making multiple-line coments
